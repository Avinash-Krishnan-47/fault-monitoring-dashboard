            <h4> About the Website </h4>
            <p> This website is all about smart condition monitoring and predictive analysis where we 
                predict the health of the industrial equipment whether it is a faulty one or a healthier one <strong> in real time </strong>. This is done so as to 
                diagonise the equipment in case of any failure in the equipment . It makes use of a Machine Learning Model to predict 
                the health of the equipment and decide if it is a healthier one or a faulty one . This website is crafed specifically for 
                <strong><em> Instrumentation </em></strong> and <strong><em>Production </em></strong> engineering applications .

            <p>
                Users can input key equipment parameters such as <strong>temperature, vibration, voltage, and current</strong> and learn more about the health of their equipments .
                A dedicated <strong>Visualize</strong> section provides graphical insights and historical trends to support data-driven analysis . No physical sensors or hardware are needed â€” 
                the system works entirely on simulated or manually entered data, making it suitable for research and learning purposes . It promotes predictive maintenance, reduces equipment downtime,
                and supports Industry 4.0 practices .
