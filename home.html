            <h4> About the Website </h4>
            <p> This website is all about smart condition monitoring and predictive analysis where we 
                predict the health of the industrial equipment whether it is a faulty one or a healthier one <strong> in real time </strong>. This is done so as to 
                diagonise the equipment in case of any failure in the equipment . It makes use of a Machine Learning Model to predict 
                the health of the equipment and decide if it is a healthier one or a faulty one . This website is crafed specifically for 
                <strong><em> Instrumentation </em></strong> and <strong><em>Production </em></strong> engineering applications .
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Users can input key equipment parameters such as <strong>temperature, vibration, pressure, and humidity</strong> to assess the operational health of their machines. The system operates entirely on simulated or manually entered data, making it ideal for research, academic projects, and skill development. No physical sensors or external hardware are required. This platform encourages predictive maintenance, minimizes equipment downtime, and supports the adoption of <strong>Industry 4.0</strong> practices. </p>
